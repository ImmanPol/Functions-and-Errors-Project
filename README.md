# Solidity Smart Contract: Require(), Assert(), and Revert()

## Overview

This repository contains a simple Solidity smart contract named `ValidationContract` that demonstrates the usage of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements. These statements are essential for enforcing preconditions, validating internal state, and handling exceptional cases in smart contract development. Additionally, the contract showcases ownership control mechanisms.

## Requirements

To interact with the smart contract, you'll need:
- A development environment for Ethereum smart contracts (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat)
- An Ethereum wallet or client (e.g., MetaMask) to deploy and interact with the contract on a testnet or mainnet

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd solidity-assertions

3. Open the ValidationContract.sol file in your preferred Solidity development environment.

4. Compile the smart contract.

5. Deploy the smart contract to your desired Ethereum network (testnet or mainnet).

6. Interact with the deployed contract using the provided functions, such as addValue(), assertTest(), revertExample(), and criticalFunction().

##Code Explanation

- require(): Used in the addValue() function and onlyOwner modifier to enforce conditions that must be met for a function to execute successfully. It helps validate inputs and restrict access to functions.
- assert(): Used in the assertTest() function to check for internal errors and invariant violations within the contract. It's crucial for ensuring the integrity of the contract's state.
- revert(): Used in the revertExample() function to revert a transaction with a specified error message. It's useful for handling exceptional cases and aborting transactions when certain conditions aren't met.
- onlyOwner Modifier: Ensures that only the owner of the contract can execute certain functions, enhancing security and access control.
- criticalFunction(): A function that can only be called by the owner. It demonstrates how to add critical functionality with restricted access and emits an event when executed.
